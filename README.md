# Cluzters-Breast_Cancer_Detection
Accurate diagnosis is one of the most important processes in breast cancer treatment. In the literature, there are many studies about predicting the type of breast tumors.   
I have performed an analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet, obtained from Kaggle. This data set was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin,USA.  
Data visualization and machine learning techniques including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector classifier, decision tree, random forest were applied to this dataset.  
Python were chosen to be applied to these machine learning techniques and visualization.  Data visualization and machine learning techniques can provide significant benefits and impact cancer detection in the decision-making process.   
Results obtained with the logistic SVCl with all features included showed the highest classification accuracy (98.8%),
